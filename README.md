This notebook contains the code for the Blindness Detection. The goal of this project is to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy in images. The severity is an integer between 0 and 4, where 0 indicates no diabetic retinopathy and 4 indicates the highest severity of diabetic retinopathy.

class 0 = No DR
class 1 = Mild
class 2 = Moderate
class 3 = Severe
class 4 = Proliferative DR
